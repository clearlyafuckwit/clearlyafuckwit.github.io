I have decided to pursue a masters degree in computer science. When I was younger, I always wanted to devote my life to something. Back then it was to be either a [Pokémon master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SeGoR8ZzUY) or, more realistically, a Shaolin Monk. I still want to live in isolation somewhere in the Himalayas, but I figured a masters in computer science was the closest I could get to being a Pokémon master.

In my undergrad years, I rarely went to class. The few times I did, I spent my time making fun of other students or programming funny things.

{% highlight java %}
class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    int i = 0;
    while(true)
    {
      ++i;
      System.out.print("8");
      for(int j=0; j < i; ++j)
      {
        System.out.print("=");
      }
      System.out.println("D");
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
I found that shit hilarious.


These days I'm much more serious, but I stay true to my roots. In school and work, I am a professional, outside, I'm the same old kid. It's not a good thing, but I figured if my life goal is to be a hermit, then it can't hurt.

That being said, last week was a sort of orientation week at NYU. I learned some interesting things!

__1. Understanding Accents__


First of all, if you want to be a CS grad student at NYU, you better be able to understand Indian and Chinese accents! Luckily I went to CS undergrad, so I made a great deal of friends that have various accents. A lot of students are foreign, and they're all very intelligent, unfortunately they also have to master another language to accomodate studying in NYU.


__2. America!!__


After speaking to a couple of Indian guys, I found out that they really wanted to learn about American culture. It was kind of cool, but I had to explain that American culture varies depending on location, and since they're in NYC, they better learn NYC culture! The first thing they asked was how to get American girls. If I was an authority on how to get ~~American~~ girls, I probably wouldn't be writing this blog. However, I wasn't going to admit that to my new found Indian friends, so I told them the best method is to hit the gym 24/7. Figured that'll help their chances!

__3. Fueling__


Another thing I learned is that grad students are fueled by two things: caffeine and alcohol. Since I abstain from either, it seems like I have a daunting path ahead of me. Whatever, I'll get by on my sugar. Unfortunately it means I'll be less social than I was in undergrad. Fortunately I aspire to be a hermit, and I've far exceeded the amount of friends needed to be one. Another fortunate happenstance is that I am American, so I'm hot shit in CS grad school.

__First day of class__


Finally, today was supposed to be my first day of class. It was also the first day of a winter storm. Naturally winter storm > class, so class was cancelled. I couldn't be happier!
